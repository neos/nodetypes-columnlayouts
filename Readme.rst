Neos Column-Layout NodeTypes
----------------------------

This package offers content NodeTypes for two, three and four column layouts in a very simple manner. Please consider this a example implementation - you probably want to implement your own.

Attention
---------

This package renders a layout div, like `<div class="container columns-25-75">[content]</div>` for a two column layout with a left 25% column and on the right a 75% column. You need to bring your own CSS, which implements the layout.
